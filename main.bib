Kim et al-This content was downloaded from Abstract For the first time, scalings for density peaking in tokamaks are obtained from a database consisting of observations from two devices, ASDEX Upgrade and JET. The investigation relies on an inversion method for the interferometer signals which grants consistent reconstructions despite differences in interferometer geometries. By combining observations from these devices, correlations between physics parameters investigated for their role in determining density peaking are reduced. Multiple regression analyses show that in the combined database collisionality is the most relevant parameter. The particle source provided by neutral beam injection provides a contribution to the peaking, which, although not negligible, is not large enough to explain the whole observed variation of density peaking. The device size, introduced as an alias for possible systematic differences between the devices not captured by the regression parameters, is found to play only a small role in regressions which include collisionality. Device size becomes relevant in scalings which exclude collisionality and include the ratio of the density to the Greenwald density limit. This indicates that density peaking is more likely to be a function of collisionality rather than of the fraction of the density limit. All the scalings which include collisionality in the regression variables predict a peaked density profile for the ITER standard scenario.},

abstract = {The transport barrier which exists at the plasma edge in the high-confinement (H-mode) regime is now recognized as important to global energy confinement. Recently, detailed measurements of the width and height of barriers in electron and ion density and/or temperature have been made on several divertor tokamaks. These results are reviewed, with an emphasis on scalings of the pedestal height and width. Many experiments observe situations in which the limiting pedestal pressure gradient is well described by ideal ballooning stability. In some cases the extreme edge is in the 'second stable' regime. Differences between the widths of pedestals in electron and ion temperature and densities are noted in several experiments. Some reported scalings are Ti = 3.3 √ $\epsilon$$\rho$ i,pol on JT-60U, and Pe /R ∝ $\beta$ 0.4 pol,ped on DIII-D. Te is independent of plasma current in many experiments. Theoretical modelling of the fully developed H-mode pedestal is reviewed. Several recent predictions of the pedestal parameters and their scalings are outlined and compared with experiments.},

Theory-motivated models are used for the pedestal width and pressure gradient, while the pedestal density is obtained from experimental data in this study. The pedestal pressure gradient is assumed to be limited by the ballooning mode instability and is expressed in terms of the magnetic shear and geometrical factors. The effect of the bootstrap current, which reduces the magnetic shear in the steep pressure gradient region at the edge of the H-mode plasma, is included in the determination of the magnetic shear. Approaches for calculating the magnetic shear, combined with proposed models for the pedestal width, are used to determine the pedestal temperature. The computed pedestal temperatures are compared with more than 500 measured pedestal temperatures for type 1 ELMy H-mode discharges in four tokamaks. Some of the uncertainties in these results are discussed, and directions for future work to improve edge pedestal scalings are described.},

@article{elongation,
abstract = {In this and the accompanying paper the problem of the maximally achievable elongation in a tokamak is investigated. The work represents an extension of many earlier studies, which were often focused on determining the elongation limits due to (1) natural elongation in a simple applied pure vertical field or (2) axisymmetric stability in the presence of a perfectly conducting wall. The extension investigated here includes the effect of the vertical stability feedback system which actually sets the maximum practical elongation limit in a real experiment. A basic resistive wall stability parameter (gammatau) is introduced to model the feedback system which although simple in appearance actually captures the essence of the feedback system. Elongation limits in the presence of feedback are then determined by calculating the maximum elongation against n=0 resistive wall modes for fixed gammatau. The results are obtained by means of a general formulation culminating in a variational principle which is particularly amenable to numerical analysis. The principle is valid for arbitrary profiles but simplifies significantly for the Solov'ev profiles, effectively reducing the 2-D stability problem into a 1-D problem. The accompanying paper provides the numerical results and leads to a sharp answer of how much elongation is too much?},

@article{arc,
abstract = {The affordable, robust, compact (ARC) reactor is the product of a conceptual design study aimed at reducing the size, cost, and complexity of a combined fusion nuclear science facility (FNSF) and demonstration fusion Pilot power plant. ARC is a ∼200-250 MWe tokamak reactor with a major radius of 3.3 m, a minor radius of 1.1 m, and an on-axis magnetic field of 9.2 T. ARC has rare earth barium copper oxide (REBCO) superconducting toroidal field coils, which have joints to enable disassembly. This allows the vacuum vessel to be replaced quickly, mitigating first wall survivability concerns, and permits a single device to test many vacuum vessel designs and divertor materials. The design point has a plasma fusion gain of Q{\textless}inf{\textgreater}p{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} ≈ 13.6, yet is fully non-inductive, with a modest bootstrap fraction of only ∼63{\%}. Thus ARC offers a high power gain with relatively large external control of the current profile. This highly attractive combination is enabled by the ∼23 T peak field on coil achievable with newly available REBCO superconductor technology. External current drive is provided by two innovative inboard RF launchers using 25 MW of lower hybrid and 13.6 MW of ion cyclotron fast wave power. The resulting efficient current drive provides a robust, steady state core plasma far from disruptive limits. ARC uses an all-liquid blanket, consisting of low pressure, slowly flowing fluorine lithium beryllium (FLiBe) molten salt. The liquid blanket is low-risk technology and provides effective neutron moderation and shielding, excellent heat removal, and a tritium breeding ratio ≥ 1.1. The large temperature range over which FLiBe is liquid permits an output blanket temperature of 900 K, single phase fluid cooling, and a high efficiency helium Brayton cycle, which allows for net electricity generation when operating ARC as a Pilot power plant.},

@techreport{doe19,
abstract = {Overview The mission of the Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) program is to expand the fundamental understanding of matter at very high temperatures and densities and to build the scientific foundation needed to develop a fusion energy source. This is accomplished through the study of plasma, the fourth state of matter, and how it interacts with its surroundings. Plasma science is wide-ranging, since 99{\%} of the visible universe is composed of plasmas of various types. High-temperature fusion plasmas at hundreds of millions of degrees occur in national security applications, albeit for very short times. The same fusion plasmas could be exploited in the laboratory in a controlled fashion to become the basis for a future clean nuclear power source, which will provide domestic energy independence and security. This is a large driver for the FES subprograms focused on the scientific study of "burning plasma." In the burning plasma state of matter, the nuclear fusion process itself provides the dominant heat source for sustaining the plasma temperature. Such a self-heated plasma can continue to undergo fusion reactions that produce energy, without requiring the input of heating power from the outside, and thus resulting in large net energy yield. In the FES program, foundational science for burning plasmas is obtained by investigating the behavior of laboratory fusion plasmas confined with strong magnetic fields. The DIII-D National Fusion Facility and the National Spherical Torus Experiment-Upgrade (NSTX-U) are world-leading Office of Science (SC) user facilities for experimental research available to and used by scientists from national laboratories, universities, and industry research groups. Complementing these experimental activities is a significant effort in fusion theory and simulation to predict and interpret the complex behavior of plasmas as self-organized systems. As part of this effort, FES supports several Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) centers in partnership with the Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program office. FES also investigates the behavior of plasmas that are confined near steady state. U.S. scientists take advantage of international partnerships to conduct research on superconducting tokamaks and stellarators with long-duration capabilities. In addition, the development of novel materials, a research area of high interest to many scientific fields, is especially important for fusion energy sciences since fusion plasmas create an environment of high-energy neutrons and huge heat fluxes that impinge on and damage the material structures containing the plasmas. The frontier scientific area of the actual creation of strongly self-heated fusion burning plasmas will allow the discovery and study of new scientific phenomena relevant to fusion as a future energy source. The FES program also supports discovery plasma science in research areas such as plasma astrophysics, high energy density laboratory plasmas (HEDLP), and low temperature plasmas. Some of this research is carried out through partnerships with the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Also, U.S. scientists are world leaders in the invention and development of new high-resolution plasma measurement techniques. A recent report a from the Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory Committee (FESAC) describes how plasma science advances have led to many spinoff applications and enabling technologies with considerable economic and societal impact for the American quality of life. The FES program addresses several of the Administration's research and development budget priorities. Research in fusion has the potential to contribute to American energy dominance by making available to the American people a robust base-load electricity clean energy technology that relies on widely available and virtually inexhaustible fuel sources. Research in plasma science, within and beyond fusion, will contribute to American prosperity through the tremendous potential for spinoff applications as well as targeted investments in early-stage low temperature plasma research that can lead to the development of transformative technologies. Investments in our major fusion facilities and smaller-scale experiments will help maintain and modernize our research infrastructure for continuing to conduct world-leading research. Established partnerships within and outside DOE maximize leverage and increase the cost effectiveness of FES research activities. Finally, the unique scientific challenges and rigor of fusion and plasma physics research lead to the development of a well-a},

abstract = {There is no disputing that the world is facing an energy crisis of vast proportions. But this could have been avoided. For more than five decades, scientists, engineers, energy planners, policy-makers, and, at times, even the public at large, have known what the ultimate alternative is to our finite energy resources-nuclear fusion. This energy, which powers the Sun and all of the stars, and can use a virtually unlimited supply of isotopes of hydrogen, available from seawater, has been visible on the horizon for years, but seemingly never close at hand. Why? Legend has it that there are more problems in attaining controlled nuclear fusion than scientists anticipated, and that little progress has been made. "Fusion is still 50 years away, and always has been" has become the common refrain of skeptics. But the reason that we do not have commercially available fusion energy is not what is commonly believed.

abstract = {Tokamak power plants are studied with advanced and conservative design philosophies to identify the impacts on the resulting designs and to provide guidance to critical research needs. Incorporating updated physics understanding and using more sophisticated engineering and physics analysis, the tokamak configurations have developed a more credible basis compared with older studies. The advanced configuration assumes a self-cooled lead lithium blanket concept with SiC composite structural material with 58{\%} thermal conversion efficiency. This plasma has a major radius of 6.25 m, a toroidal field of 6.0 T, a q95 of 4.5,a $\beta$total N of 5.75, an H98 of 1.65, an n/nGr of 1.0, and a peak divertor heat flux of 13.7 MW/m2. The conservative configuration assumes a dual-coolant lead lithium blanket concept with reduced-activation ferritic martensitic steel structural material and helium coolant, achieving a thermal conversion efficiency of 45{\%}. The plasma has a major radius of 9.75 m, a toroidal field of 8.75 T, a q95 of 8.0, a $\beta$total N of 2.5, an H98 of 1.25, an n/nGr of 1.3, and a peak divertor heat flux of 10 MW/m2. The divertor heat flux treatment with a narrow power scrape-off width has driven the plasmas to larger major radius. Edge and divertor plasma simulations are targeting a basis for high radiated power fraction in the divertor, which is necessary for solutions to keep the peak heat flux in the range 10 to 15 MW/m2. Combinations of the advanced and conservative approaches show intermediate sizes. A new systems code using a database approach has been used and shows that the operating point is really an operating zone with some range of plasma and engineering parameters and very similar costs of electricity.

abstract = {Considering the worldwide increase of interest in fusion research over the last decade - the recognition that a large number of new, environmentally attractive, sustainable energy sources will be needed to meet ever-increasing demands for electrical energy, is obvious. This book serves up the latest interest in alternative energy. Based on a series of graduate course notes in plasma physics and fusion energy at MIT, the text begins with an overview of world energy needs, current methods of energy generation, and the potential role that fusion may play in the future. It covers energy issues such as the production of fusion power, power balance, the design of a simple fusion reactor, and the basic plasma physics issues faced by the developers of fusion power. This book is suitable for graduate students and researchers working in applied physics and nuclear engineering.},

abstract = {An improved energy confinement regime, I-mode, is studied in Alcator C-Mod, a compact high-field divertor tokamak using ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRFs) auxiliary heating. I-mode features an edge energy transport barrier without an accompanying particle barrier, leading to several performance benefits. H-mode energy confinement is obtained without core impurity accumulation, resulting in reduced impurity radiation with a high-Z metal wall and ICRF heating. I-mode has a stationary temperature pedestal with edge localized modes typically absent, while plasma density is controlled using divertor cryopumping. I-mode is a confinement regime that appears distinct from both L-mode and H-mode, combining the most favourable elements of both. The I-mode regime is investigated predominately with ion ∇B drift away from the active X-point. The transition from L-mode to I-mode is primarily identified by the formation of a high temperature edge pedestal, while the edge density profile remains nearly identical to L-mode. Laser blowoff injection shows that I-mode core impurity confinement times are nearly identical with those in L-mode, despite the enhanced energy confinement. In addition, a weakly coherent edge MHD mode is apparent at high frequency ∼100–300 kHz which appears to increase particle transport in the edge. The I-mode regime has been obtained over a wide parameter space (BT = 3–6 T, Ip = 0.7–1.3MA, q95 = 2.5–5). In general, the I-mode exhibits the strongest edge temperature pedestal (Tped) and normalized energy confinement (H98 {\textgreater} 1) at low q95 ({\textless}3.5) and high heating power (Pheat {\textgreater} 4MW). I-mode significantly expands the operational space of edge localized mode (ELM)-free, stationary pedestals in C-Mod to Tped ∼ 1 keV and low collisionality $\nu$∗ ped ∼ 0.1, as compared with EDA H-mode with Tped {\textless} 0.6 keV, $\nu$∗ has a relatively weak degradation with heating power;Wth ∼ IpP0.7 (Some figures in this article are in colour only in the electronic version},

abstract = {Tokamak discharges with improved energy confinement properties arising from internal transport barriers (ITBs) have certain attractive features, such as a large bootstrap current fraction, which suggest a potential route to the steady-state mode of operation desirable for fusion power plants. This paper first reviews the present state of theoretical and experimental knowledge regarding the formation and characteristics of ITBs in tokamaks. Specifically, the current status of theoretical modelling of ITBs is presented; then, an international ITB database based on experimental information extracted from some nine tokamaks is described and used to draw some general conclusions concerning the necessary conditions for ITBs to appear, comparing these with the theoretical models. The experimental situation regarding the steady-state, or at least quasi-steady-state, operation of tokamaks is reviewed and finally the issues and prospects for achieving such operational modes in ITER are discussed. More detailed information on the characteristics of ITBs in some 13 tokamaks (as well as helical devices) appears in the appendix.},

@misc{greenwald,
abstract = {In addition to the operational limits imposed by MHD stability on plasma current and pressure, an independent limit on plasma density is observed in confined toroidal plasmas. This review attempts to summarize recent work on the phenomenology and physics of the density limit. Perhaps the most surprising result is that all of the toroidal confinement devices considered operate in similar ranges of (suitably normalized) densities. The empirical scalings derived independently for tokamaks and reversed-field pinches are essentially identical, while stellarators appear to operate at somewhat higher densities with a different scaling. Dedicated density limit experiments have not been carried out for spheromaks and field-reversed configurations, however, `optimized' discharges in these devices are also well characterized by the same empirical law. In tokamaks, where the most extensive studies have been conducted, there is strong evidence linking the limit to physics near the plasma boundary: thus, it is possible to extend the operational range for line-averaged density by operating with peaked density profiles. Additional particles in the plasma core apparently have no effect on density limit physics. While there is no widely accepted, first principles model for the density limit, research in this area has focussed on mechanisms which lead to strong edge cooling. Theoretical work has concentrated on the consequences of increased impurity radiation which may dominate power balance at high densities and low temperatures. These theories are not entirely satisfactory as they require assumptions about edge transport and make predictions for power and impurity scaling that may not be consistent with experimental results. A separate thread of research looks for the cause in collisionality enhanced turbulent transport. While there is experimental and theoretical support for this approach, understanding of the underlying mechanisms is only at a rudimentary stage and no predictive capability is yet available.},

Hellesen et al -On current drive by Ohkawa mechanism of electron cyclotron wave in large inverse aspect ratio tokamaks Pingwei Zheng et al -Applicability of inverse heat flux evaluation to thermographic measurements in SPIDER R.S. Delogu et al -This content was downloaded from IP address 18.101. Abstract. Heating and current drive systems must fulfil several roles in ITER operating scenarios: heating through the H-mode transition and to ignition; plasma burn control; current drive and current profile control in steady state scenarios; and control of MHD instabilities. They must also perform ancillary functions, such as assisting plasma start-up and wall conditioning. It is recognized that no one system can satisfy all of these requirements with the degree of flexibility that ITER will require. Four heating and current drive systems are therefore under consideration for ITER: electron cyclotron waves at a principal frequency of 170 GHz; fast waves operating in the range 40–70 MHz (ion cyclotron waves); lower hybrid waves at 5 GHz; and neutral beam injection using negative ion beam technology for operation at 1 MeV energy. It is likely that several of these systems will be employed in parallel. The systems have been chosen on the basis of the maturity of physics understanding and operating experience in current experiments and on the feasibility of applying the relevant technology to ITER. Here, the fundamental physics describing the interaction of these heating systems with the plasma is reviewed, the relevant experimental results in the exploitation of the heating and current drive capabilities of each system are discussed, key aspects of their application to ITER are outlined, and the major technological developments required in each area are summarized.},

@article{process,
abstract = {a b s t r a c t PROCESS is a reactor systems code – it assesses the engineering and economic viability of a hypothetical fusion power station using simple models of all parts of a reactor system, from the basic plasma physics to the generation of electricity. It has been used for many years, but details of its operation have not been previously published. This paper describes some of its capabilities. PROCESS is usually used in optimisation mode, in which it finds a set of parameters that maximise (or minimise) a figure of merit chosen by the user, while being consistent with the inputs and the specified constraints. Because the user can apply all the physically relevant constraints, while allowing a large number of parameters to vary, it is in principle only necessary to run the code once to produce a self-consistent, physically plausible reactor model. The scope of PROCESS is very wide and goes well beyond reactor physics, including conversion of heat to electricity, buildings, and costs, but this paper describes only the plasma physics and magnetic field calculations. The capabilities of PROCESS in plasma physics are limited, as its main aim is to combine engineering, physics and economics. A model is described which shows the main plasma features of an inductive ITER scenario. Significant differences between the PROCESS results and the published scenario include the bootstrap current and loop voltage. The PROCESS models for these are being revised. Two new models for DEMO have been obtained. The first, DEMO A, is intended to be " conservative " in that it might be possible to build it using the technology of the near future. For example, since current drive technologies are not yet mature, only 12{\%} of the current is assumed to be due to current drive. Consequently it is a pulsed machine, able to burn for only 1.65 hours at a time. Despite the comparatively large size (major radius is 9 m), the fusion power is only 1.95 GW. The assumed gross thermal efficiency is 33{\%}, giving just 465 MW net electric power. The second, DEMO B, is intended to be " advanced " in that more optimistic assumptions are made. Comparison of DEMO A and B with a reference ITER scenario shows that current drive and bootstrap fraction need the most extrapolation from the perspective of plasma physics.},

@article{minervini,
abstract = {This paper attempts to bridge the gap between tokamak reactor design and plasma physics. The analysis demonstrates that the overall design of a tokamak fusion reactor is determined almost entirely by the constraints imposed by nuclear physics and fusion engineering. Virtually, no plasma physics is required to determine the main design parameters of a reactor: a, R0, B0, Ti, Te, p, n, $\tau$E, I. The one exception is the value of the toroidal current I , which depends upon a combination of engineering and plasma physics. This exception, however, ultimately has a major impact on the feasibility of an attractive tokamak reactor. The analysis shows that the engineering/nuclear physics design makes demands on the plasma physics that must be satisfied in order to generate power. These demands are substituted into the well-known operational constraints arising in tokamak physics: the Troyon limit, Greenwald limit, kink stability limit, and bootstrap fraction limit. Unfortunately, a tokamak reactor designed on the basis of standard engineering and nuclear physics constraints does not scale to a reactor. Too much current is required to achieve the necessary confinement time for ignition. The combination of achievable bootstrap current plus current drive is not sufficient to generate the current demanded by the engineering design. Several possible solutions are discussed in detail involving advances in plasma physics or engineering. The main contribution of the present work is to demonstrate that the basic reactor design and its plasma physics consequences can be determined simply and analytically. The analysis thus provides a crisp, compact, logical framework that will hopefully lead to improved physical intuition for connecting plasma physic to tokamak reactor design.},
