The goal of fusion energy research is to build a profitable reactor. This thesis develops a cost estimate of fusion reactors from a physicist's perspective. It then applies this cost metric to the two main operation schemes for a tokamak reactor: pulsed and steady-state. In the end, an apples-to-apples comparison is developed, which is used to explain: the relative advantages of the two modes of operation, as well as, the design parameters tha
t provide the highest leverage in lowering machine costs.
