abstract = {Overview The mission of the Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) program is to expand the fundamental understanding of matter at very high temperatures and densities and to build the scientific foundation needed to develop a fusion energy source. This is accomplished through the study of plasma, the fourth state of matter, and how it interacts with its surroundings. Plasma science is wide-ranging, since 99{\%} of the visible universe is composed of plasmas of various types. High-temperature fusion plasmas at hundreds of millions of degrees occur in national security applications, albeit for very short times. The same fusion plasmas could be exploited in the laboratory in a controlled fashion to become the basis for a future clean nuclear power source, which will provide domestic energy independence and security. This is a large driver for the FES subprograms focused on the scientific study of "burning plasma." In the burning plasma state of matter, the nuclear fusion process itself provides the dominant heat source for sustaining the plasma temperature. Such a self-heated plasma can continue to undergo fusion reactions that produce energy, without requiring the input of heating power from the outside, and thus resulting in large net energy yield. In the FES program, foundational science for burning plasmas is obtained by investigating the behavior of laboratory fusion plasmas confined with strong magnetic fields. The DIII-D National Fusion Facility and the National Spherical Torus Experiment-Upgrade (NSTX-U) are world-leading Office of Science (SC) user facilities for experimental research available to and used by scientists from national laboratories, universities, and industry research groups. Complementing these experimental activities is a significant effort in fusion theory and simulation to predict and interpret the complex behavior of plasmas as self-organized systems. As part of this effort, FES supports several Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) centers in partnership with the Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program office. FES also investigates the behavior of plasmas that are confined near steady state. U.S. scientists take advantage of international partnerships to conduct research on superconducting tokamaks and stellarators with long-duration capabilities. In addition, the development of novel materials, a research area of high interest to many scientific fields, is especially important for fusion energy sciences since fusion plasmas create an environment of high-energy neutrons and huge heat fluxes that impinge on and damage the material structures containing the plasmas. The frontier scientific area of the actual creation of strongly self-heated fusion burning plasmas will allow the discovery and study of new scientific phenomena relevant to fusion as a future energy source. The FES program also supports discovery plasma science in research areas such as plasma astrophysics, high energy density laboratory plasmas (HEDLP), and low temperature plasmas. Some of this research is carried out through partnerships with the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Also, U.S. scientists are world leaders in the invention and development of new high-resolution plasma measurement techniques. A recent report a from the Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory Committee (FESAC) describes how plasma science advances have led to many spinoff applications and enabling technologies with considerable economic and societal impact for the American quality of life. The FES program addresses several of the Administration's research and development budget priorities. Research in fusion has the potential to contribute to American energy dominance by making available to the American people a robust base-load electricity clean energy technology that relies on widely available and virtually inexhaustible fuel sources. Research in plasma science, within and beyond fusion, will contribute to American prosperity through the tremendous potential for spinoff applications as well as targeted investments in early-stage low temperature plasma research that can lead to the development of transformative technologies. Investments in our major fusion facilities and smaller-scale experiments will help maintain and modernize our research infrastructure for continuing to conduct world-leading research. Established partnerships within and outside DOE maximize leverage and increase the cost effectiveness of FES research activities. Finally, the unique scientific challenges and rigor of fusion and plasma physics research lead to the development of a well-a},

@techreport{fusionnever,
abstract = {There is no disputing that the world is facing an energy crisis of vast proportions. But this could have been avoided. For more than five decades, scientists, engineers, energy planners, policy-makers, and, at times, even the public at large, have known what the ultimate alternative is to our finite energy resources-nuclear fusion. This energy, which powers the Sun and all of the stars, and can use a virtually unlimited supply of isotopes of hydrogen, available from seawater, has been visible on the horizon for years, but seemingly never close at hand. Why? Legend has it that there are more problems in attaining controlled nuclear fusion than scientists anticipated, and that little progress has been made. "Fusion is still 50 years away, and always has been" has become the common refrain of skeptics. But the reason that we do not have commercially available fusion energy is not what is commonly believed. An inside analysis of how the U.S. fusion program was euthanized, dispels the myth that "fusion can't work."

abstract = {In the European strategy towards fusion power, a demonstration tokamak fusion reactor (DEMO) is foreseen as the next single step between ITER and a power plant. The current baseline concept is a tokamak reactor with net electrical output power of P el ∼500MW and plasma pulse duration of t pulse ∼2h. Systems codes are commonly used in the design process as numerical tools for optimization studies. The key performance data of the reactor such as P el and t pulse are depending on a variety of design and plasma parameters. In the application of systems codes within this multi-dimensional parameter space, a clear quantitative understanding of the most suitable optimization criteria has to be developed, and various physics and technology limits should be obeyed to obtain meaningful results.In this work we use a fusion reactor systems code to perform parameter variations for a pulsed DEMO tokamak reactor. Various output quantities are presented as a basis for the quantitative assessment of the numerical results, and options for a further development of the current DEMO baseline design are proposed and briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Tokamak power plants are studied with advanced and conservative design philosophies to identify the impacts on the resulting designs and to provide guidance to critical research needs. Incorporating updated physics understanding and using more sophisticated engineering and physics analysis, the tokamak configurations have developed a more credible basis compared with older studies. The advanced configuration assumes a self-cooled lead lithium blanket concept with SiC composite structural material with 58{\%} thermal conversion efficiency. This plasma has a major radius of 6.25 m, a toroidal field of 6.0 T, a q95 of 4.5,a $\beta$total N of 5.75, an H98 of 1.65, an n/nGr of 1.0, and a peak divertor heat flux of 13.7 MW/m2. The conservative configuration assumes a dual-coolant lead lithium blanket concept with reduced-activation ferritic martensitic steel structural material and helium coolant, achieving a thermal conversion efficiency of 45{\%}. The plasma has a major radius of 9.75 m, a toroidal field of 8.75 T, a q95 of 8.0, a $\beta$total N of 2.5, an H98 of 1.25, an n/nGr of 1.3, and a peak divertor heat flux of 10 MW/m2. The divertor heat flux treatment with a narrow power scrape-off width has driven the plasmas to larger major radius. Edge and divertor plasma simulations are targeting a basis for high radiated power fraction in the divertor, which is necessary for solutions to keep the peak heat flux in the range 10 to 15 MW/m2. Combinations of the advanced and conservative approaches show intermediate sizes. A new systems code using a database approach has been used and shows that the operating point is really an operating zone with some range of plasma and engineering parameters and very similar costs of electricity. Other papers in this issue provide more detailed discussion of the work summarized here.},

@article{imode,
abstract = {An improved energy confinement regime, I-mode, is studied in Alcator C-Mod, a compact high-field divertor tokamak using ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRFs) auxiliary heating. I-mode features an edge energy transport barrier without an accompanying particle barrier, leading to several performance benefits. H-mode energy confinement is obtained without core impurity accumulation, resulting in reduced impurity radiation with a high-Z metal wall and ICRF heating. I-mode has a stationary temperature pedestal with edge localized modes typically absent, while plasma density is controlled using divertor cryopumping. I-mode is a confinement regime that appears distinct from both L-mode and H-mode, combining the most favourable elements of both. The I-mode regime is investigated predominately with ion ∇B drift away from the active X-point. The transition from L-mode to I-mode is primarily identified by the formation of a high temperature edge pedestal, while the edge density profile remains nearly identical to L-mode. Laser blowoff injection shows that I-mode core impurity confinement times are nearly identical with those in L-mode, despite the enhanced energy confinement. In addition, a weakly coherent edge MHD mode is apparent at high frequency ∼100–300 kHz which appears to increase particle transport in the edge. The I-mode regime has been obtained over a wide parameter space (BT = 3–6 T, Ip = 0.7–1.3MA, q95 = 2.5–5). In general, the I-mode exhibits the strongest edge temperature pedestal (Tped) and normalized energy confinement (H98 {\textgreater} 1) at low q95 ({\textless}3.5) and high heating power (Pheat {\textgreater} 4MW). I-mode significantly expands the operational space of edge localized mode (ELM)-free, stationary pedestals in C-Mod to Tped ∼ 1 keV and low collisionality $\nu$∗ ped ∼ 0.1, as compared with EDA H-mode with Tped {\textless} 0.6 keV, $\nu$∗ has a relatively weak degradation with heating power;Wth ∼ IpP0.7 (Some figures in this article are in colour only in the electronic version},

This paper first reviews the present state of theoretical and experimental knowledge regarding the formation and characteristics of ITBs in tokamaks. Specifically, the current status of theoretical modelling of ITBs is presented; then, an international ITB database based on experimental information extracted from some nine tokamaks is described and used to draw some general conclusions concerning the necessary conditions for ITBs to appear, comparing these with the theoretical models. The experimental situation regarding the steady-state, or at least quasi-steady-state, operation of tokamaks is reviewed and finally the issues and prospects for achieving such operational modes in ITER are discussed.
